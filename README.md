## Facial Emotion Recognition Using Deep Learning

### In this project, we leverage the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to develop a model capable of recognizing and detecting facial emotions. CNNs are a type of deep learning architecture particularly well-suited for image analysis tasks due to their ability to automatically learn and extract features from images.
